Here I stand on the edge<br>
A crumbling cliff face ahead of me<br>
A stray just off wind could snend me tumbling down<br>
<br>
And as I look back up the hill<br>
What once was a steep unending slope<br>
seems like nothing but a molehill<br>
<br>
Can I do it?<br>
Can I still ventue forth?<br>
What if I fall?<br>
If I can't make it back? <br>
<br>
I'm scared.<br>

                    I felt homesick today <br>
                    As if something were missing in my life<br>
                    And yet it doesn't fade<br>
                    No matter how hard I strife<br>
                    <br>
                    I know what must be done<br>
                    I know where to go<br>
                    I should feel the sun<br>
                    Under the old willow<br>
                    <br>
                    Grounding my feet, I stretch my roots<br>
                    Feeling my blood, anew, rebirthed<br>
                    Into the sky, my flower shoots<br>
                    I am at home with mother earth<br>

                    And before I knew it, I was flying<br>
                    With you, it seemed anything was possible<br>
                    Faster, higher, I flew more and more until<br>
                    I was falling<br>
                    <br>
                    Down, tumbling down<br>
                    Falling faster and faster without restraint<br>
                    My sun, how could you do this? <br>
                    Falling for you<br>

                <p>
there is a goddess in this small town<br>
or perhaps she's but a lonely ghost<br>
You can hear her in the streets, see her in the park<br>
if you're lucky she'll talk to you before it's too late<br>
she'll tell you to run as far as you can<br>
and that you deserve better then what you have<br>
<br>
<br>
but yet there's an ache in her voice<br>
more a warning than a suggestion<br>
not to make the same mistake, to wind up stuck<br>
living forever in your tiny hometown<br>
another voice lost, or possibly never found<br>
