                It's almost been a year since we meet. August 24th, The Beths.<br>
                Or maybe it was earlier? I do not remember going to Stella's Birthday however..<br>
                Regardless, a year of talking to you, and wow.<br>
                On one hand, it's just one year;<br>
                on the other, one whole entire year.<br>
                <br>
                This has been one of the smoothest friendships I've ever had.<br>
                It may sound like I'm repeating myself, but everything flows so naturally when talking to you.<br>
                I truly cannot wait to spend more years in your care.<br>
                And hopefully, hang out with you again in person.<br>

                Who doesnt like being showered in compliments? I hope you do, because that's what this section is.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                You are one of the most genuinely kind people i know. Talking to-and being with-you feels like one is in a soft, safe space. Not many people can create such an authentic space, but you seem to be able to.<br>
                <br>
                You have such a love and appreciation for all things beautiful that I have found myself slowing down and noticing more and more beauty in the world.<br>
                <br>                
                <br>
                Of course I can mention how absolutely gorgeous and pretty you are, but that goes without saying.<br>
                <br>
                Would much rather say that you've built such an amazing image of yourself as this outgoing, bubbly, and loving person.<br>

                This is really just me putting words on a page, but we see the world in a similar way so you might enjoy it ^-^<br>
                <br>
                One of the things that everybody talks about that I dont belive in is Falling In Love. My love has always been a choice, a commitment that I specifically want to make. Love to me is two people who share a connection (a spark, of sorts) and both make an effort to deepen that connection and to build on top of it.<br>
                <br>
                I may be aromantic? I still want to spend the rest of my life with someone or someones, however. <br>
                <br>
                Any romantic relationship I've had could've been a close friendship, and any close friendship a romantic relationship. The only difference is both parties making an agreement to deepen our connection.<br>
                <br>
                I dunno, you may like the sentiment though.<br>

                My whole life long I learned to love.<br>
                This hour my utmost art I prove<br>
                And speak my passion--heaven or hell?<br>

                <br>
                <br>
                Go sit upon the lofty hill,<br>
                And turn your eyes around,<br>
                Where waving woods and waters wild<br>
                 Do hymn an autumn sound<br>
                The summer sun is faint on them-<br>
                 The summer flowers depart-<br>
                Sit still-a all transformed to stone,<br>
                 Except your musing heart.<br>

                the gap of your shirt, why cover it up?<br>
                Why shouldn't your legs and your good strong thighs<br>
                be rough and hiary? -- I'm glad they are like that.<br>
                You are shy, you silly, you silly shy thing.<br>

                In conclusion, I love you so much. You truly are a blessing in my life, and not a day goes by that I'm not thankful for that.<br>
                I do feel sorry that I couldn't give you anything more significant, but sincerly hope that you've enjoyed what I have cobbled together.<br>
                I don't see us not being friends anytime soon; so when we reunite, lets celebrate both our birthdays in earnest.<br>
                <br>
                Nonetheless I hope you have a wonderful day today, and that its only good vibes.<br>
